üëãüèΩ Welcome to the September Pact Blog, where we'll be covering all the updates in the Pact ecosystem along with events & material you've been sharing across the web.

## Pact OSS Updates

### Pact-Plugins

Back in March, [we mentioned](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2024/07/30/pact-open-source-update-july-2024#pact-go) some issues leverage the Pact-Plugin framework with Pact-Go.

I'm pleased to say that the change in the pact-plugins repo, was [accepted and merged](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-plugins/pull/69), to change the loading mechanism for plugins, from Tokio tasks, to System threads.

Chat with us in: [#pact-plugins](https://pact-foundation.slack.com/archives/CA2S7E6KC).

### Pact-JS

Pact-JS-CLI is now smaller, and leaner, with os/arch specific npm packages created for all
supported platforms, thanks to this [PR](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-cli/pull/14). The resolution for packages should be invisible to the end user, resulting in smaller downloads, and less disk-space being used by redundant files.

Available from V16.x - See the release notes for more [detail](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-cli/releases/tag/v16.0.0)

:::info TL;DR
    $ npx --package=@pact-foundation/pact-cli -c 'pact-broker version'
    1.76.1

Want to see the same change in pact-js-core? Why not let us know!

### Pact-Go

The pact-plugin update to switch from tokio tasks, to system threads was accepted, which allowed us to add the [change](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/pull/451) to Pact-Go, hopefully fixing random panics during plugin based tests, highlighted in this [issue](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/issues/269).

Initial feedback is really positive. If you had this issue before, and it now appears to be resolved, why not let us know?

CGO or not to CGO? - In an infamous post by Dave Cheney, he mentions [cgo is not go](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go), and the mandatory requirement of cgo, in pact-go v2 has caused some users issues in initial setup. We have the potential to mitigate this requirement, by leveraging a project called [ebitengine/purego](https://github.com/ebitengine/purego), which describes itself as a library for calling C functions from Go, without Cgo. You can track the [issue](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/issues/452) and associated pull request, to find out more.

Alpine Linux - We've been trying to get Pact working across alpine, natively, for all of our supported client languages, GoLang included. Follow the progress [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/issues/453). We are blocked at the moment due to some segfaults during the verification process and would appreciate any extra eyes, if this feature enhancement would be useful to you.

### Pact-Python

Some examples using the Pact-Python V3 interface, have now been included in the repo, thanks to [Amit S](https://github.com/amit828as) in this [PR](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/pull/783).

[Val Kolovos](https://github.com/valkolovos) is also working on a Matcher proof of concept [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/pull/761) in order to try and complete this open [issue](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/issues/746) to Implement a `Matcher` interface.

### Pact-PHP

Tien has began some incremental improvements in Pact-PHP V10, now that that v10 is now GA.

Two notable additions include

- [feat: All custom provider headers](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-php/pull/627)
- [feat: Add graphql example](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-php/pull/634)

These changes are currently on the master branch and unreleased, so will require to use the [`dev-master`](https://packagist.org/packages/pact-foundation/pact-php#dev-master) version if you want to pick them up.

### Pact Ruby

[@trammel](https://github.com/trammel) submitted a [PR](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby/pull/322) to remove webrick from a dependency to a dev-dep over in pact-ruby, however it will need [pact_mock-service](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-mock_service) to be updated to use an alternative over webrick, and to be able to drop it as a runtime dependency completely. If anyone fancies attempting this, please let us know.

Webrick suffered a round of CVE's recently, so the Pact ruby ecosystem has been updated (pact-ruby-cli, pact-ruby-standalone, pact-broker).

### Pact Broker

:::warning Deprecation notices

The Pact Broker image was updated to leverage Ruby 3.3.5 in v2.122.0.

#### Pact Broker Chart

[Shane Hull](https://github.com/shanehull) added the ability to set svc annotations, check out his PR [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-broker-chart/pull/88). It was merged and released this month.

### Pact Net

Pact-Net V5 Beta 3 has now been [released](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-net/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta.3). It [contains several fixes and features](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-net/milestone/5?closed=1), including leveraging the latest pact ffi 0.4.23

V5 of pact-net is considered to be pretty stable, and is being used in a few production workflows and we expect it to become GA very soon. If you want to leverage the Pact V4 Specification, which will allow you to have multiple interaction types in a single Pact file, you should upgrade now!
