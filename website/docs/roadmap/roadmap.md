description: Pact Specification and Feature Roadmap

## RFC Process

Pact follows an RFC process to introduce new ecosystem-wide features into the ecosystem. The RFC process is described at [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/roadmap/pull/96).

## Requesting new features

For changes that affect the entire ecosystem, you can request, comment and view the status of feature requests at the main [issue tracker](https://github.com/pact-foundation/roadmap/issues).

For changes specific to a project, they should be directed to the relevant projects github issue track (e.g. for Pact JS it should go to https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/issues).

## Standards and Specifications

For changes to the interop format of the contract (pact) files, see the [Pact Specification](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/).
