Before you keep going, if you are considering using a self signed certificate, do consider using a free CA signed certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) instead. It will save you a lot of hassle configuring self signed certificates everywhere you connect to the Pact Broker.

## Connecting to a Pact Broker running over TLS

### With a CA signed certificate

You shouldn't need to do anything, as the certificate authority's certificate should already be loaded into the store of your system.

### With a self signed certificate

#### For JVM

Search for "Specifying a custom trust store" in the search bar and select the results for the appropriate tool.

#### For non-JVM

Set the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable to point to a local file containing the certificate in PEM format. It will look something like this:

```

You'll need to configure the certificate both your development environment and your CI. It's a bit of a hassle, so again, do consider a CA signed certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) instead.

You can use this [Docker Compose](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-broker-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file to spike and troubleshoot connecting to a broker with a self signed certificate. Once you have run `docker-compose up` once and seen it work with the built in files, replace the certificate and key files with your own and run `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up`.

##### Extracting a copy of the certificate from a running Pact Broker

If you do not already have a copy of the certificate, you can extract it from Firefox.

* Open a page in the Pact Broker in Firefox
* Click on the lock icon next to the address bar
* Click on the ">" (Show connection details) button
* Click "More information"
* Click "View Certificate"
* Scroll down to Miscellaneous
* Click "PEM (chain)" in the Download section
