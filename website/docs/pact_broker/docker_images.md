title: Dockerized Pact Broker
sidebar_label: Overview
---

The Pact Broker is an application for sharing for Pact contracts and verification results, and is required for integrating Pact into CI/CD pipelines.

There is currently one supported Docker image based on [Alpine, running on Puma](/pact_broker/docker_images/pactfoundation).

While there are [high level instructions][rollyourown] provided for running the application outside of Docker, we cannot provide support for these installations, as there are too many variables.

## In a hurry?

If you want to try out a Pact Broker that can be accessed by all your teams, without having to fill in infrastructure requisition forms and wait for 3 months, you can get a free trial at <a href="https://pactflow.io/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=dockerized_pact_broker_index">pactflow.io</a>. Built by a group of core Pact maintainers, PactFlow is a fork of the OSS Pact Broker with extra goodies like an improved UI, field level verification results, and user and teams management. It's also fully supported, and that means when something goes wrong, *someone else* gets woken up in the middle of the afternoon to fix it...
